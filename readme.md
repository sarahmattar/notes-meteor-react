# notes-meteor-react

This is a notes application built on Meteor, using MongoDB and React.

It was a tutorial app for Andrew Mead's course, [Full Stack Web Apps With React
and Meteor](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001kiAkoZcFlbRHg=/). I am currently in the process of updating it to 2019 standards: React (16.8.x) and React-Router (4.x).

### Instructions for Installation

Running the application requires Meteor to be installed. To install Meteor, go [here](https://www.meteor.com).

Install node_modules for the project:

`meteor npm install`

Launch the application:

`meteor`

### Running Tests

This application has a number of tests, built with Enzyme and Mocha, to ensure that content is distributed correctly across fields and database insertion proceeds without fail.

To run tests, please use `npm test`.

You can view the test reporter at http://localhost:3000.
