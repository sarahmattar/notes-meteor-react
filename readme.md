# notes-meteor-react

This is a notes application built on Meteor, using MongoDB and React.

It was a tutorial app for Andrew Mead's course, [Full Stack Web Apps With React
and Meteor](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001kiAkoZcFlbRHg=/). I am currently in the process of updating it to 2019 standards: React (16.8.x) and React-Router (4.x). 

## Instructions for Installation

Running the application requires Meteor to be installed. To install Meteor, go [here](https://www.meteor.com).

Install node_modules for the project:

`meteor npm install`

Launch the application:

`meteor`

## Running Tests

Running the tests is easy. All you have to do is run the following command and
view the reporter at http://localhost:3000.

`npm test`
